## Purpose of Application

This application is designed to send users a once weekly text with optimized fantasy football lineup reccomendations. Users create accounts associated with their phone numbers, allowing them to save multiple rosters. Rankings are updated weekly based on data from FantasyFootballNerd.com. Messages and ranking updates have been automated using advanced python scheduler. 

## How to Run.

I have deployed a working version to https://jselzer626.github.io/FFLO_Client/. If you want to run the application locally please download this repo and use "npm start" to launch.
